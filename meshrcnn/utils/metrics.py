    Compute evaluation metrics to compare meshes. We currently compute the
    following metrics:

    - L2 Chamfer distance
    - Normal consistency
    - Absolute normal consistency
    - Precision at various thresholds
    - Recall at various thresholds
    - F1 score at various thresholds

    Inputs:
        - pred_meshes (Meshes): Contains N predicted meshes
        - gt_meshes (Meshes): Contains 1 or N ground-truth meshes. If gt_meshes
          contains 1 mesh, it is replicated N times.
        - num_samples: The number of samples to take on the surface of each mesh.
          This can be one of the following:
            - (int): Take that many uniform samples from the surface of the mesh
            - 'verts': Use the vertex positions as samples for each mesh
            - A tuple of length 2: To use different sampling strategies for the
              predicted and ground-truth meshes (respectively).
        - scale: How to scale the predicted and ground-truth meshes before comparing.
          This can be one of the following:
            - (float): Multiply the vertex positions of both meshes by this value
            - A tuple of two floats: Multiply the vertex positions of the predicted
              and ground-truth meshes by these two different values
            - A string of the form 'gt-[SCALE]', where [SCALE] is a float literal.
              In this case, each (predicted, ground-truth) pair is scaled differently,
              so that bounding box of the (rescaled) ground-truth mesh has longest
              edge length [SCALE].
        - thresholds: The distance thresholds to use when computing precision, recall,
          and F1 scores.
        - reduce: If True, then return the average of each metric over the batch;
          otherwise return the value of each metric between each predicted and
          ground-truth mesh.
        - eps: Small constant for numeric stability when computing F1 scores.

    Returns:
        - metrics: A dictionary mapping metric names to their values. If reduce is
          True then the values are the average value of the metric over the batch;
          otherwise the values are Tensors of shape (N,).
